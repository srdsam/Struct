# Struct - An Organizational App

**Objective: Create an app that helps users organize their day-to-day tasks, set deadlines, and automate routine tasks.**

## I. User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) Design

Minimalistic and clean design inspired by the C++ struct data type.
1. Use a monochromatic color scheme with shades of gray, white, and black.
2. Use a monospaced font to maintain the coding aesthetic.
3. Allow customization of the interface (e.g., dark/light mode, font size).

## II. App Features

Task List
a. Daily tasks automatically generated (e.g., meditate, tidy up).
b. Custom tasks added by the user (e.g., work or learning tasks).
c. Drag and drop functionality to reorder tasks.
d. Task priority indicator (low, medium, high).

Task Details
a. Task title and description.
b. Option to attach notes, images, and files.
c. Deadlines and reminders.
d. Task status (not started, in progress, completed, blocked).
e. Task history log (e.g., when created, when completed).

Calendar Integration
a. Sync with external calendars (e.g., Google Calendar, Apple Calendar).
b. Display daily tasks on the calendar.
c. Schedule tasks with specific start and end times.

Progress Tracking
a. Daily and weekly task completion overview.
b. Visual progress indicators (e.g., progress bars, charts).
c. Achievements and streaks to encourage consistency.

Settings and Customization
a. Option to create and edit task templates for routine tasks.
b. Customizable daily task generation.
c. Notifications and reminders.

## III. Technology Stack

Frontend: React Native or Flutter for cross-platform app development.
Backend: Node.js with Express.js for API development.
Database: MongoDB or Firebase for storing user data and tasks.
Authentication: OAuth2.0 for secure user authentication.
Third-Party Integrations: Google Calendar API, Apple Calendar API.

## IV. Development and Deployment

Agile methodology for iterative development and regular feedback.
Continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
Monitor app performance and user feedback for continuous improvements.
